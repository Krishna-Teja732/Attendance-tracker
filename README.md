# Attendance-tracker 

This code is used to track student attendance. The application has two users namely staff and student. 

1. Student - A student can view his/her attendance for all the courses (in which he/she is enrolled in). The student has to enter name and roll number for username and password respectively. 

2. Staff - Staffs can login using course code as the user name and a default password. 
  * View attendance - in this window attendance, of all the students, can be viewed. 
  * Change entry - this option allows the staff to change the attendance of a particular student by entering his/her roll number and name. 
  * Attendance entry - this option allows the staff to enter attendance for the entire class. The staff can choose between manual attendance or automatic attendance. In manual the staff has to select present for each student. If the attendance of any student is missing, an error message is shown. In automatic attendance, all the students are given present by default.
